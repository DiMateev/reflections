How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?



    Only difference between both files are shown, nothing else.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer
in the long term?

 

   Be able to find bugs in tousend of lines of code fast. 



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?



    Pros: Saving only versions which are relevant to the project and not filled with bugs ones.
    Cons: Forgetting to commit last updates to stable version

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?



    Because some changes are interconnected between multiple files and it won't make sense commiting changes on different files separetly.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?
